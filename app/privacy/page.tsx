            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Sharing and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. "Sale" under CCPA/CPRA includes monetary or other valuable consideration; We do not engage in such activities. Disclosures are limited to:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
              <li>Service Providers: Third parties (e.g., cloud storage like AWS, analytics tools like Google Analytics) who assist with operations, bound by contracts ensuring data protection and limiting use to our instructions.</li>
              <li>Affiliates: Within our corporate group for internal purposes.</li>
              <li>Legal Requirements: To comply with laws, subpoenas, court orders, or government requests; to protect rights, safety, or property; or in emergencies.</li>

            <p>For cross-border transfers (e.g., data stored in US servers while operating in Canada), We ensure adequate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or reliance on adequacy decisions.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (e.g., encryption, access controls, regular audits) to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. However, no system is infallible, and We cannot guarantee absolute security. In case of a data breach, We will notify affected users and authorities as required by law (e.g., within 72 hours under certain regulations).</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined, or as required by law (e.g., tax records for 7 years). Criteria include Service provision, legal compliance, and dispute resolution. When no longer needed, data is securely deleted or anonymized. You can request deletion earlier, subject to exceptions.</p>
